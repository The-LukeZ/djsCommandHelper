```
üìÇsrc
 ‚î£ üìÑindex.js
 ‚îó üìÇcommands
   ‚îóüìÇutility
     ‚î£ üìÑping.js
     ‚îó üìÑyour-private-command.js
```

#### The command file

> **Note that for using this you need to install [discord.js](https://discordjs.guide/)!**

<summary>Fields in the command file (Click to expand)</summary>

| Key name | Description                                                                                               | Default |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| ignore   | If set to `true` then this command will be ignored upon refreshing                                        | `false` |
| guildIds | An Array of guild ids in which the command should be registered/updated ; command is global if not set    | []      |
| data     | The raw command data [Learn more about it here](https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/slash-commands) | `-`     |
| run      | The function to call (It's only important for your own logic - so name this whatever you want)            | `-`     |

`-` means that it doesn't have a default value

```js
const { SlashCommandBuilder } = require("discord.js");

module.exports = {
    ignore: true,
    guildIds: ["123456789", "987654321"], // Note: This wont automatically delete them from guilds!
    data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
        .setName("ping")
        .setDescription("Replies with Pong!"),

    // The function to call whenever the command is executed (Doesnt matter when calling client.deployCommands())
    async run(interaction) {
        await interaction.reply("Pong!");
    },
};
```

### Deploy the commands

```js
// Don't forget to load all things from discord.js

const { deployCommands } = require("djs-command-deployer");
const path = require("node:path");
require("dotenv").config(); // load your token and app's id

// Set up your client
// Use the guide as an example if you need help
// https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/main-file

// When the client is ready, run this code once.
client.once(Events.ClientReady, (readyClient) => {
    console.log(`Ready! Logged in as ${readyClient.user.tag}`);

    // Call deployCommands to refresh your commands
    deployCommands(
        path.join(__dirname, "commands", "utility")
        {
            appToken: process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN,
            appId: process.env.ClientId,
        }
        // logs are optional
    );
});

// Log in to Discord with your client's token
client.login(process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN);
```

### Delete a guild-command

Global commands can be automatically deleted if you just delete the file or set `ignore: true` and run the `deployCommands` function again.

Guild commands on the other hand need to be deleted manually.

The name of a command of an application is unique, but only in its type. Command ids are unique.
Make sure that you have command's id and not it's name.

You can get the command id by either typing in the command and then right click the description above or by giong into the guild settings > Integrations > YOUR_BOT > right mouse click on the command > **Copy Command ID**

In this example we are building a manager-command that has StringOptions for the command and the guild id where one can paste in the ID or the name.

````js
const { SlashCommandBuilder, EmbedBuilder } = require("discord.js");
const { deleteCommand } = require("djs-command-helper");

module.exports = {
    guildIds: ["12345"], // the guild id of the dev's guild so that no one can delete every command
    data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
        .setName("manage-commands")
        .setDescription("Replies with Pong!")
        .addStringOption((op) =>
            op
                .setName("command-id")
                .setDescription("The ID of the command to be removed")
        )
        .addStringOption((op) =>
            op
                .setName("server-id")
                .setDescription(
                    "The ID of the server from which the command is to be removed"
                )
        ),

    // This function is called whenever an interactionCreate event is triggered.
    async run(interaction) {
        const guildId = interaction.options.getString("server-id");
        const command = interaction.options.getString("command-id");
        await interaction.deferReply({ ephemeral: true }); // Defer to remove the risk of not responding in time

        try {
            const response = await deleteCommand(command, {
                appToken: interaction.client.token,
                appId: interaction.application.id,
                guildId: guildId,
            });
        } catch (err) {
            // respond with an error if the operation fails in some way
            return await interaction.editReply({
                embeds: [
                    new EmbedBuilder()
                        .setTitle("‚ùå Command not deleted due to an error")
                        .setDescription("```" + err + "```")
                        .setColor(0xff0000),
                ],
            });
        }

        // Success!
        await interaction.editReply({
            embeds: [
                new EmbedBuilder()
                    .setTitle("‚úÖ Command deleted")
                    .setColor(0x44ff44),
            ],
        });
    },
};
